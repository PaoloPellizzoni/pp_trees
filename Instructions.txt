############# Options ##################
The main executable runs a series of tests designed to test the correctness and efficiency
of the two libraries. The test number can be chosen with the (mandatory) option -t. Test 0
runs all the tests.  The (optional) option -p sets the flag to produce an output file. It
requires a file name as an argument. The file will be located in the binaries directory.
